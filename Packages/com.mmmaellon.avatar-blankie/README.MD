Blanket for Avatars
âš  Requires Modular Avatar: https://modular-avatar.nadena.dev/

For collisions, add capsule colliders to your avatar bones, check "Is Trigger", and then add them to the list of colliders on the *Cloth* component of the blanket's mesh.

To install, just drag and drop the "Avatar Blankie" prefab onto your avatar. I was too lazy to make a menu and the world is stuck in world space so you either have to make your own menu to toggle and reset the blanket or you can just reset your avatar wherever you want your blanket to be.
